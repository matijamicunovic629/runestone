runestone
=========

This repo was for discussion of runes, a fungible token protocol for Bitcoin.

Fungible tokens are, without exaggeration and nearly without exception, a vile
abyss of hopium, scams, and incompetence.

Runes are no different.

If you want to make money, buy bitcoin.

Runes has been implemented in [ord](https://github.com/ordinals/ord), so all
discussions, issues, and PRs should be directed there.
